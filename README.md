I am a PostoDoctoral Fellow at Georgia Institute of Technology. I have been working for the past few years primarily on open source softwares for exploration geophysics. This allowed me to develop my skills in programming in both Python and Julia and get familiar with Cloud computing on AWS and Azure.

### Research Interest

My research interest range from applied mathematics to exascale HPC. My current research topics include:

- Machine learning: I am working on cmputational methods for machine learning such as application of randomized linear algebra methods.
- HPC: Our lab focuses mainly on HPC for task parallel exascale problem such as photoacoustic or seismic imaging.
- DSLs: 
  - I am still one of the primary developper of [Devito], in particular of its symbolic APIs.
  - Main developper of [JUDI] a linear algebra DSL for PDE constraints optimization built on top of [Devito]
- PDE-constrained optimization and inverse problems: Methods and Algorithms for wave-equation based inverse problems such as photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging (medical) or subsurface imaging (sexploration geophysics).
- Cloud computing: I have been working into developping large scale algorithm runnign on the cloud since we entirely rely on Azure for industry size problems.
